This is a project done as a part of the Odin Project.

Objective is add simple UI buttons to my oprevious version of Rock Paper Scissors.

Time: <strong> ??? </strong>

My thought/working process: <br>

1. Create three buttons 
- Use document.eventListener
- Figure out how to make the button talk to the playRound() function
- When it comes to programming, have to keep abstracting and break down the problem...


<br>

2. Return value for when button is pressed
- Need to return a value/boolean for the buttonPress
- My code is all over the player and not clean atm...
- Realising that I might have to rewrite and reuse the code to achieve the end result

Going to come back to it later...
